#f-list.net F-Chat CLI client
F-Chat CLI is an ncurses like client for role playing on F-Chat.  For those that don't know, an ncurses like interface is based in the command line: all text!

This software requires node.js to run, which you can get here: http://nodejs.org/

Once you have node.js installed, grab a copy of the program from here: https://github.com/ka-vi/fchat-cli/releases 

After unzipping to a directory, go to it from a terminal, and type:
```
npm install
```

After that, create a config.js based on the config-sample.js file:
```
cp config-sample.js config.js
```

Use your favorite text editor to edit the values accordingly.  Once done, do:
```
node index.js
```
